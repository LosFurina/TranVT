# Anomaly Detection Based on Transformer via Variable and Time dimension

## 1. Introduction

This project focus on Anomaly Detection Based on Transformer via Variable and Time dimension(TranVT)
As far as researched, vanilla Transformers on Time-series dataset always ignore the function of variable or time dimension on self-attention model.
Hence, this project mainly explore the effects of Transformer on variable and time dimension
